For this milestone, our experience shows some of the mechanics and test assets we have created and obtained from the asset store for the game. The experience starts with the camera moving towards some of the puzzle assets for our game. The laser emitter is shown rotating, with the laser bouncing off of reflective cubes and passing through and activating targets. The camera moves to show some of the other assets, then focuses on the back of the room. In the back of the room, we have our test enemy asset moving across the room, periodically playing a beep sound. This is intended to test using positional audio to alert the player of the enemy's position. The player should have been able to determine the enemy's relative location throughout the experience using just the audio, but at the end we show how the enemy is moving to show how the positional audio elements work.
